=================
 Welcome to Owyl!
=================

You have Pyglet. You've got Rabbyt. But who do your sprites go to for
advice? Owyl, of course.

The goal of Owyl: provide a fast and flexible Behavior Tree library
implemented in python. For more information on Behavior Trees, see
the articles at <http://aigamedev.com/hierarchical-logic>.

Owyl has been tested on python 2.5. It will probably work on 2.6. It
definitely WILL NOT work on 2.4. Please let me know if you have any
trouble with it.
