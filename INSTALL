 Installing Owyl
=================

Install Owyl using the standard distutils method:

  $ python setup.py install

Owyl can also be installed with easy_install:

  $ easy_install owyl


Egenix mxBase
=============

Owyl will use mx.Stack if it is available. Otherwise, it uses a
regular list to emulate a stack. mx.Stack should offer a small
performance boost.

Egenix mxBase can be found and downloaded at
<http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/>.


Development and Testing
=======================

TBD


Thanks
======

with and adapt. Please visit the discussion board at
<http://groups.google.com/group/owyl-discuss/> if you run into any
trouble.
